		<!--https://robohub.org/the-state-of-telepresence-healthcare-and-telemedicine/ -->
		<p>A robot by the name of RITA (Reliable Interactive Table Assistant) by RoboValley out of the Netherlands.<br>
		This is more of a caregiver robot than telepresence, but because of its primary function, can be classified as telepresence.<br>
		RITA can monitor the behavior of a patient, alerting medical staff of significant changes, and allowing a care taker or physician to check in when alerts arise.</p>
