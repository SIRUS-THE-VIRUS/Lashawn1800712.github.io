		<h1>Collaborative Telepresence in Education</h1>
		<p> <em>According to Campus Technology</em>, “telepresence instruction is not about online learning
		at all. Instead, the goal is to extend the face-to-face experience of in-class instruction to remote areas and other schools.”<br></p>

		<p>Students dealing with difficult situations are successfully able to attend and participate in their classes remotely via the telepresence robots instead of missing class sessions or dropping classes entirely</p>
